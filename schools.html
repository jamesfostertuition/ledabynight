      <h2>Individual Instrument Tuition</h2>
      <p>I believe that music in schools should be kept alive through passionate teaching of a high standard.</p>
      <h2>Teachers</h2>
      <p>All lessons are taught by myself. I am a qualified teacher with QTS (Primary Specialisation), 6 years experience of working with schools and all relevant safeguarding information. Upon arrival, the school are provided with a valid, up to date DBS check, certificate of public liability insurance and all documentation with regards to students.</p>
      <h2>My requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Children with a passion for music and a commitment to learning</li>
        <li>A suitable room to accommodate lessons</li>
      </ul>
      <img  class = "text-image right" src="images/FullSizeRender 51.jpg" alt="Classical Guitar">
      <h2>Syllabus</h2>
      <p>Traditional techniques and music theory are implemented and taught in a way that works with present day music. Students learn from a carefully crafted syllabus to take beginners to a Grade 1 standard within 3 terms of lessons with consistent attendance and practise.
      <br/>Both guitar and violin are taught to the Trinity Guildhall classical syllabus although other exam boards can be used upon request of the parents/school.</p>
      <h2>Administration and Invoicing</h2>
      <p>Enrolment forms, invoicing and collection of fees for music lessons can be time consuming and a strain on an already busy School Office. I provide all administration with regards to new students, invoicing and collecting payment directly from parents.</p>
