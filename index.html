      <h2>Your music, your passion.</h2>
	  <h3>Guitar Lessons in Leicester with qualified teacher James Foster</h3>	
      <p>As a musician of any level it is tempting to teach yourself to play or improve your skills. With the huge range of books, videos and online resources available many students find it overwhelming to say the least. Progress can be slow and you may find yourself acquiring bad habits; you may even stop playing completely.<p/>
      <p>Good tutors assess your playing and adapt their lessons in response to what they see. They answer questions and can inspire you with their own enthusiasm. Books and online resources are great, but they don’t interact with you in the same way a teacher can.</p>
      <p>Having a tutor is one of the best ways to make the progress you want to make.<p/>
      <ul>
        <li>All abilities and ages welcome</li>
        <li>Expert tuition in a relaxed atmosphere</li>
        <li>Lessons tailored to student’s individual needs</li>
        <li>Step by step approach to learning</li>
        <li>No need to bring your own instrument or amplifier</li>
		<li>Lessons in your own home or my studio, situated near to city centre Leicester</li>
      <ul/>
      <h3>Give me a call to discuss what having lessons can do for you.</h3>
