      <p>As a primary school teacher of 5 years, I have an excellent understanding of various methods of teaching, and the importance of adapting to a student’s style of learning in order to ensure progression.</p>
      <p>I am a member of the Musicians’ Union, complete regular updates on child protection and safeguarding with North West Leicestershire County Council, and have an enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (formally CRB) check that is available to see upon request.<p/>
