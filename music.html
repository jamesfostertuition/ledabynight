      <p>I tailor lessons to the studentâ€™s individual needs and can either focus on graded material from a variety of exam boards, or on learning songs from a wide range of musical genres in order to develop their own style.<p/>
      <p>I teach electric, acoustic, classical and bass guitar, and violin to beginner learners who have never held an instrument before, to more advanced learners wishing to develop technique or further their knowledge.</p>
      <p>I cover a large range of styles that are not limited to: rock, pop, jazz, classical, metal and folk. I also teach composition and theory within these styles.<p/>
      <p>Exam boards covered:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>RSL (Rockschool)</li>
        <li>Trinity Guildhall (Rock and pop, and classical)</li>
        <li>ABRSM (Classical)</li>
      <ul/>
      <p>Lessons can be arranged from my teaching studio in Newfoundpool, Leicester, or home visits in the Leicestershire area.</p>
      <h2>Beginners</h2>
      <p>Firm foundations are the basis of a versatile musician. During the beginning stages it is important to focus on body position, holding the instrument and production of sound. Without this, the learner will make progress at first, but this will be hindered as they move onto more complex pieces of music or more complicated techniques.</p>
      <p>Learners will work on a custom syllabus that develops a versatile musical knowledge as well as a working knowledge of music theory. Lessons are adadpted during lessons to cater for different learners.</p>
	  <p>Learn the music you want to learn.</p>
